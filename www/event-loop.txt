  $("#settings-button").click(function(){
        $( "#dialog" ).dialog({
                       buttons: {
                           "Change": function() {
                               var default_screen= $('input[name="change-default"]').val();
                               calculator.change_default(default_screen);
                               $('input[name="change-default"]').val("0");
                               $( this ).dialog( "close" );
                           },
                           Cancel: function() {
                               $( this ).dialog( "close" );
                           }
                       }
                   });
    });

This part of the code is invokes when the user clicks on the button with the id "settings-button".
This is done by the jquery syntax of getting to object when someone clicks on it.
When the button is clicked there is a function that doing  a 'dialog'  to the the dialog windows. This is a jquery-ui method that 
opens a dialog windows in the center of the main windows that 'protected' from the main window content. 
In the next line I'm defined the 'buttons:' all the buttons that will appear in this windows. As we can see in the next lines,
there will be two buttons: the first one is 'Change' that when we click on it there is a function that assign the value of the 
input filed with the name 'change-default' (this is the input filed that the user insert to it the new default value), and after that,
changing the value of the default value in the calculator object. In the end, it set the value of the input filed to be zero and close the dialog windows.
The next line is for the button Cancel. When this button is clicked a function that close the dialog windows is invokes.


Lines 32-35 in profile.js:

$("#clear-button").click(function(){
        var result = calculator.clear();
        $("#screen-text").val(result);
    }); 

This part of the code is invokes when the user click on the button with the id 'clear-button'.
This is done by the jquery syntax of getting to object when someone clicks on it.
When the button is clicked there is a function that create a variable and insert to it the default value of the 
calculator object by using the object method 'clear'.
In the next line it's insert to the input field with the id 'screen-text' the value that received from the calculator object 
in the previous line.
