Features in JavaScript that does not exist in Java:

1)dynamic typing - 
In JavaScript there is dynamic typing unlike Java.
Dynamic typing languages dynamically infer the types of objects, instead of forcing you to define them, 
and then enforce those types when the program runs in the interpreter.
In Javascript yoy can write:
var x=1; (int x=1) 
and than:
x="blblbab"
but in java int x= "blblbab" doesn't compile.

2)Anonymous functions - 
In JavaScript the name of the function can be omitted unlike Java.
In JavaScript you can defined a function with no name that will called in 
some situations (like I did in my code). 
In Java you need to give to every function a name when you defined that function.

3)Closures 
In JavaScript you can defined clousures unlike Java.
A closure is local variables for a function that  kept alive after the function has returned - is a stack-frame which is not deallocated when
the function returns

For exemple the following code return reference to a function:

function hello(name) {
    var hello = 'Hey ' + name;
    var alerty = function() { alert(hello); }
    return alerty;
}
say_hello = hello('Dani');
say_hello(); 
This code alerts "Hey Dani"
